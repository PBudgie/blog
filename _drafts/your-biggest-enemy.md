# Your Biggest Enemy

> "I've never done that before."
> "I don't want him/her/them to judge me."
> "I'm waiting on someone else to do their part first."

Many people find themselves saying things like this in professional and personal settings. These phrases all have one thing in common: you can add "I can't do it because..." to the beginning. I like calling them mental blocks. Most people I know employ these phrases in their career or in their personal life, while the people I look up to seemed say it much less.

I work in the world of software development, where success is in part measured by how much code or product I can deliver. Any time I'm blocked, it results in productivity loss. Wouldn't it be great if I could eliminate as many mental blocks as I could? If not for efficiency, at least for my sanity. I hate twiddling my thumbs.

Every new developer faces the first mental block. "I've never done that before," stems from fear of the unknown. Ugh, I have to take the time and patience to learn something new. Plus, I don't know what I'm doing. What if I mess something up? I should get someone to help me, it'd be faster. It's not bad per se to think this way, but the thought after this one should always be, "Why?" Are you really so inconfident in your own ability to learn something that you need someone to handhold you through it? And even if your more experienced teammate did so, would you really learn as well as if you had figured it out on your own? For a commonly used, well documented framework, it's easy to Google any problems you run into. And with the state of software development, local testing means that you won't need to worry about messing any production or sensitive code. You have room to experiment. Why hold yourself back from learning? This thought is even more common in 

"I don't want him/her/them to judge me" is often used because of the fear of being looked down on. I'll never be as good as them. What if they think I'm stupid? Often, this thought prevents you from asking questions. 

"I'm blocked by someone else" is a tricky one. Sometimes, you really are blocked because another team or developer hasn't delivered code that you need 

It's inevitable that you'll run into these mental blocks. It's important to conquer your fears
